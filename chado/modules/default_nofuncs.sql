COMMENT ON TABLE featureloc IS 'The location of a feature relative to
another feature. Important: interbase coordinates are used. This is
vital as it allows us to represent zero-length features e.g. splice
sites, insertion points without an awkward fuzzy system. Features
typically have exactly ONE location, but this need not be the
case. Some features may not be localized (e.g. a gene that has been
characterized genetically but no sequence or molecular information is
available). Note on multiple locations: Each feature can have 0 or
more locations. Multiple locations do NOT indicate non-contiguous
locations (if a feature such as a transcript has a non-contiguous
location, then the subfeatures such as exons should always be
manifested). Instead, multiple featurelocs for a feature designate
alternate locations or grouped locations; for instance, a feature
designating a blast hit or hsp will have two locations, one on the
query feature, one on the subject feature. Features representing
sequence variation could have alternate locations instantiated on a
feature on the mutant strain. The column:rank is used to
differentiate these different locations. Reflexive locations should
never be stored - this is for -proper- (i.e. non-self) locations only; nothing should be located relative to itself.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.feature_id IS 'The feature that is being located. Any feature can have zero or more featurelocs.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.srcfeature_id IS 'The source feature which this location is relative to. Every location is relative to another feature (however, this column is nullable, because the srcfeature may not be known). All locations are -proper- that is, nothing should be located relative to itself. No cycles are allowed in the featureloc graph.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.fmin IS 'The leftmost/minimal boundary in the linear range represented by the featureloc. Sometimes (e.g. in Bioperl) this is called -start- although this is confusing because it does not necessarily represent the 5-prime coordinate. Important: This is space-based (interbase) coordinates, counting from zero. To convert this to the leftmost position in a base-oriented system (eg GFF, Bioperl), add 1 to fmin.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.fmax IS 'The rightmost/maximal boundary in the linear range represented by the featureloc. Sometimes (e.g. in bioperl) this is called -end- although this is confusing because it does not necessarily represent the 3-prime coordinate. Important: This is space-based (interbase) coordinates, counting from zero. No conversion is required to go from fmax to the rightmost coordinate in a base-oriented system that counts from 1 (e.g. GFF, Bioperl).';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.strand IS 'The orientation/directionality of the
location. Should be 0, -1 or +1.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.rank IS 'Used when a feature has >1
location, otherwise the default rank 0 is used. Some features (e.g.
blast hits and HSPs) have two locations - one on the query and one on
the subject. Rank is used to differentiate these. Rank=0 is always
used for the query, Rank=1 for the subject. For multiple alignments,
assignment of rank is arbitrary. Rank is also used for
sequence_variant features, such as SNPs. Rank=0 indicates the wildtype
(or baseline) feature, Rank=1 indicates the mutant (or compared) feature.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.locgroup IS 'This is used to manifest redundant,
derivable extra locations for a feature. The default locgroup=0 is
used for the DIRECT location of a feature. Important: most Chado users may
never use featurelocs WITH logroup > 0. Transitively derived locations
are indicated with locgroup > 0. For example, the position of an exon on
a BAC and in global chromosome coordinates. This column is used to
differentiate these groupings of locations. The default locgroup 0
is used for the main or primary location, from which the others can be
derived via coordinate transformations. Another example of redundant
locations is storing ORF coordinates relative to both transcript and
genome. Redundant locations open the possibility of the database
getting into inconsistent states; this schema gives us the flexibility
of both warehouse instantiations with redundant locations (easier for
querying) and management instantiations with no redundant
locations. An example of using both locgroup and rank: imagine a
feature indicating a conserved region between the chromosomes of two
different species. We may want to keep redundant locations on both
contigs and chromosomes. We would thus have 4 locations for the single
conserved region feature - two distinct locgroups (contig level and
chromosome level) and two distinct ranks (for the two species).';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.residue_info IS 'Alternative residues,
when these differ from feature.residues. For instance, a SNP feature
located on a wild and mutant protein would have different alternative residues.
for alignment/similarity features, the alternative residues is used to
represent the alignment string (CIGAR format). Note on variation
features; even if we do not want to instantiate a mutant
chromosome/contig feature, we can still represent a SNP etc with 2
locations, one (rank 0) on the genome, the other (rank 1) would have
most fields null, except for alternative residues.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN featureloc.phase IS 'Phase of translation with
respect to srcfeature_id.
Values are 0, 1, 2. It may not be possible to manifest this column for
some features such as exons, because the phase is dependant on the
spliceform (the same exon can appear in multiple spliceforms). This column is mostly useful for predicted exons and CDSs.';

 with rank indicating query/subject';
COMMENT ON COLUMN analysisfeature.identity IS 'Percent identity between the locations compared.

COMMENT ON COLUMN analysisfeature.significance IS 'This is some kind of expectation or probability metric, representing the probability that the analysis would appear randomly given the model. As such, any program or person querying this table can assume the following semantics:
   * 0 <= significance <= n, where n is a positive number, theoretically unbounded but unlikely to be more than 10
  * low numbers are better than high numbers.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN analysisfeature.normscore IS 'This is the rawscore but
    semi-normalized. Complete normalization to allow comparison of
    features generated by different programs would be nice but too
    difficult. Instead the normalization should strive to enforce the
    following semantics: * normscores are floating point numbers >= 0,
    * high normscores are better than low one. For most programs, it would be sufficient to make the normscore the same as this rawscore, providing these semantics are satisfied.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN analysisfeature.rawscore IS 'This is the native score generated by the program; for example, the bitscore generated by blast, sim4 or genscan scores. One should not assume that high is necessarily better than low.';
